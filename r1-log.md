### R1D1 [8/20/19]
    Todays coding was mostly related to changing up my portfolio. I hadnt looked back on it in a while, and the functionality is... basically non-existent when it comes to mobile friendly, which DESPERATELY needs to be changed. 
    I realized, unfortunately, it is extremely blaz√©. 
        
    If I expected any company to look at this and recall anything about me, I would be left sorely disppointed.

    So while the colors and theme are true to my style, there really isnt much of my personality. 
    
    I went through updating some of the code, and working on an old mock up to see which aspects I like more. Tomorrow should be an interesting one for sure! 
    
    Day one DONE!
### R1D2
    I got caught up in the day, thought I had myself all organized, and ended up not commiting to myself, or my code. So that was a disappointment. 
### R1D3
    Today I got back in the swing of thing, but found myself trying to code 15 different things, and getting little bits done, but not really accomplishing much. I worked through some of the coding challenges in LeetCode, and was fixing and adding to my Bootstrap Practice page. 
    The day before I did some wireframing for my portfolio rebuild, so I have a bit of a road map for the process.

    I also built out a bit more of a game plan for myself. I have a few trips and vacations planned in the next three weeks and I dont want to miss out of lose moemntum, so I have a plan for the times that I wont be able to access internet, or my computer to continue pushing myself.
